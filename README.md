A simple cryptography program that uses RSA-2048 to allow a user to encrypt and decrypt files as well as input using a private and public key pair (which it can generate) and a password that's securely passed through the program using the getpass library.

Other features of the program are:
  - Ability to choose input and output locations for keys and encrypted/decrypted files with shell arguments
  - Generate a random, variable-length string that includes numbers and special characters
  - Option for verbose output with each feature
