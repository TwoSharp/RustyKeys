A simple asymmetric cryptography program and library class working with RSA 2048-bit, allowing the user to encrypt and decrypt files and input using a private and public key pair (which the program can also generate) and a password that's securely passed through using the getpass library.

Other features of the program are:
  - Ability to choose input and output locations for keys and encrypted/decrypted files
  - Generate a random, variable-length string with numbers and special characters
  - Option for verbosity
